# SimplifyX
A student-friendly math expression simplifier and calculus calculator with step-by-step verification.
# Math Expression Simplifier

This project is a compact, student-focused web calculator designed to simplify algebraic expressions and assist with calculus operations such as differentiation and integration.

While many expression solvers already exist, they are often cluttered, complex, or not intuitive for students. This tool focuses on clarity, usability, and verification, helping learners cross-check their work and reduce algebraic and calculus errors.

## Key Features
- Algebraic expression simplification
- Differentiation of expressions
- Basic integration with constant of integration
- Step-by-step simplification (where applicable)
- Expression verification by differentiating results
- Mode-based operation (Simplify / Differentiate / Integrate)
- Digital math input buttons for faster and cleaner expression entry

## Why This Project?
Students frequently make mistakes while simplifying expressions during differentiation or integration, and there is often no easy way to verify results. This tool aims to bridge that gap by providing a clean interface and reliable symbolic computation.

## Target Users
- High school and undergraduate students
- Engineering and science learners
- Anyone learning algebra and calculus

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python (SymPy) / Node.js (Math.js)
- API-based symbolic computation
## Google Technology Integration
This project integrates the Google Gemini API to generate clear, human-readable explanations for simplified expressions and calculus results, helping students understand each transformation step rather than just viewing the final answer.

## Project Status
Currently under development (Hackathon Project)
